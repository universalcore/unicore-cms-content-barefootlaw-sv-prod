(Article 28)\r\n \r\nChildren should be able to learn different things at school. They have the right to a quality education that supports the flowering of their personalities. School is important as a preparation for adult life, and should, among other things, teach them to live in peace, to protect the environment and to respect other people. (Article 29)\r\n\r\nChildren have the right to know what is important for their welfare. Radio, television, books, newspapers, computers, etc. help them to grow up and educate themselves.
