Last week, my cousin Agnes aged 11 years ran away from our village in Kapchorwa and is now living with me. She said she was being forced to undergo genital mutilation and she decided to run away from home. I want to know how I can help her. \r\n\r\n[Kno da Facts][1]\r\n\r\n[Take Action!][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/c58c8f233ba54c5f8adb1a92106f5213/\r\n  [2]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/e3c3d13e71d44acdb8e385955a025860/",
