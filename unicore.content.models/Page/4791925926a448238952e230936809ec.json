Under the Laws of Uganda, customary marriages are recognised as long as they abide by the Constitution of Uganda. \r\n\r\nAccording to decided cases, payment of bride price is not wife purchase. A marriage is only entered into by free consent of the parties involved; no one can be forced to enter into a marriage they do not wish to undertake.\r\n\r\n[Cases][1]\r\n\r\n[Take Action!][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/3b4daf75e6fd4ccd81f4063011d7e455/\r\n  [2]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/477f08974012491f86745b902ad6e3bd/",
