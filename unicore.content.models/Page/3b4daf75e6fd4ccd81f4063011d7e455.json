During the burial, Mark's relatives said that since they had paid bride price for Cissy, she belongs to them and as a result, the relatives have taken her away as a third wife to Ken, Mark\u2019s younger brother. Cissy was unhappy about the whole situation and has run away back to her parent\u2019s home.[T1]\r\n\r\n[Kno da Facts][1]\r\n\r\n[Take Action!][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/4791925926a448238952e230936809ec/\r\n  [2]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/477f08974012491f86745b902ad6e3bd/",
